## 🐛 If Nothing Happens

The extension has some TypeScript errors that need fixing. I'm working on that now.

**Alternative:** Wait for me to fix the build errors, then try again.

## 📝 Note

The extension code has React components that aren't compatible with VS Code extensions. I'm simplifying it to make it work.
